#script that computes the observed coherence (pointwise mutual information, normalised pmi or log
#conditional probability)
#steps:
#1. sample the word counts of the topic words based on the reference corpus
#2. compute the observed coherence using the chosen metric

#parameters
metric="npmi" #evaluation metric: pmi, npmi or lcp
#input
topic_file="../logs/slot_head_words.txt"
ref_corpus_dir="gn"
#output
wordcount_file="../logs/wc-oc.txt"
oc_file="../logs/slots-oc.txt"
